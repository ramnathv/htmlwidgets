\usage{
createWidget(name, x, width = NULL, height = NULL,
  sizingPolicy = htmlwidgets::sizingPolicy(), package = name,
  dependencies = NULL, elementId = NULL, digits = 16)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Widget name (should match the base name of the YAML and JavaScript
files used to implement the widget)}

\item{x}{Widget instance data (underlying data to render and options that
govern how it's rendered). This value will be converted to JSON using
\code{\link[RJSONIO:toJSON]{RJSONIO::toJSON}} and made available to the
widget's JavaScript \code{renderValue} function.}

\item{width}{Fixed width for widget (in css units). The default is
\code{NULL}, which results in intelligent automatic sizing based on the
widget's container.}

\item{height}{Fixed height for widget (in css units). The default is
\code{NULL}, which results in intelligent automatic sizing based on the
widget's container.}

\item{sizingPolicy}{Options that govern how the widget is sized in various
containers (e.g. a standalone browser, the RStudio Viewer, a knitr figure,
or a Shiny output binding). These options can be specified by calling the
\code{\link{sizingPolicy}} function.}

\item{package}{Package where the widget is defined (defaults to the widget
name).}

\item{dependencies}{Additional widget HTML dependencies (over and above those
defined in the widget YAML). This is useful for dynamic dependencies that
only exist when selected widget options are enabled (e.g. sets of map tiles
or projections).}

\item{elementId}{Use an explicit element ID for the widget (rather than an
automatically generated one). Useful if you have other JavaScript that needs
to explicitly discover and interact with a specific widget instance.}

\item{digits}{Number of significant digits to use for the widget data.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{htmlwidget} that will intelligently print
 itself into HTML in a variety of contexts including the R console, within R
 Markdown documents, and within Shiny output bindings.
}
\description{
Create an HTML widget based on widget YAML and JavaScript contained within the
specified package.
